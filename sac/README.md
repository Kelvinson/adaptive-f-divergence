# Variational Inference with Tail-adaptive f-Divergence 

To be available soon...

[Note] we noticed that the authors of [SAC](https://github.com/haarnoja/sac/tree/master/sac) updated their codebase in Auguest after our NIPS submission. They have improved their initial results significantly. Our implementation is based on their first release and we are currently re-evaluating with their new codebase.

[SAC versions]: [first verion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01290v1.pdf), 
[second version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290v2).
